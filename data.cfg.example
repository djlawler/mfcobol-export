# The definition of every field has a form:
#
# <Field DataType>:<Field Length> [<Pick a Name>]
#
# where
# <Field DataType> can be:
#   X - Character Field
#   Z - Zoned Decimal (Unpacked)
#   P - Packed Decimal
#   N - Integer
#   * - (skip)
#
# <Field Length> is number of characters or number of digits - but not number
# of bytes! If the field is Packed Decimal then the length in bytes will
# be computed automatically.
#
# You can optionally specify a name for all non-skipped fields, which will make
# export more useful.
#
# Finally, for testing and figuring out the field layout, you can specify a validator
# for each field - a python expression that must evaluate to true.

x:10            # character field - probably key
z:226   foo  # unpacked numeric
z:3
z:3
z:12
p:11
p:11
n:4 test1    # integer stored in 4 bytes
*:5
    validate: not v.replace(' ', '')   # Validate the field just before
p:11
p:11

# Validate the first field. This will fail if the field contains non-trailing spaces.
validate 0: not ' ' in v.rstrip()

# Validate the field named foo
validate foo: v > 10
